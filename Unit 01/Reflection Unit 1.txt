In Unit 1, I have learned the basic structure of html. Like first I need to define a doctype, and html include <head> and <body>. I also learned the brief history of the web and web development. How to decorate the html is also very important. I can write html with different style of words such as bold and strong, italicize, small, mark, etc. I tried to create a simple HTML page, and after some failure, finally it works. This is a short introduction of the web and web development. I have started to learn html. It will be very useful for me to learn html because it can help me to understand the web development. Learning HTML enables me to build and structure webpages, supports career growth in web development, enhances SEO, and integrates with technologies like CSS and JavaScript for creating dynamic websites. I also explored the history of the web, learning how it evolved from simple text-based pages in the early 1990s to the dynamic, interactive websites we use today. This historical context showed me the significance of HTML as the backbone of web development. One of the most engaging aspects of Unit 1 was discovering how to style text in HTML. I learned to use tags like <b> and <strong> for bold text, <i> and <em> for italics, <small> for smaller text, and <mark> for highlighted text. These tags allow me to emphasize and decorate content, making webpages more visually appealing and user-friendly.
