In Unit 1, I have learned the basic structure of html. Like first I need to define a doctype, and html include <head> and <body>. I also learned the brief history of the web and web development. How to decorate the html is also very important. I can write html with different style of words such as bold and strong, italicize, small, mark, etc. I tried to create a simple HTML page, and after some failure, finally it works.
