Preparing for the Interview
Interviewing is a valuable skill that can help you learn more about a person, a topic, or an event. It can also help you develop your communication skills, build your confidence, and even prepare you for future job interviews. As you start thinking about the interview experience, we've identified four key principles to guide your experience:

Be safe: Conduct interviews in a public place or with a trusted adult present. Do not share personal information with the interviewee.
Be respectful: During the interview, introduce yourself and the purpose of the interview. Be sure to explain how long it will take and what you hope to achieve.
Be honest: Be honest about who you are and why you are conducting the interview. Do not misrepresent yourself or your intentions.
Be sensitive: Be sensitive to the interviewee's feelings and experiences. Do not ask questions that could be triggering or traumatic.
With these principles in mind, here are some tips and tricks to help you conduct a successful interview:

Prepare: Before the interview, prepare a list of open-ended questions that will help you understand the client's perspective and challenges. We've put together sample questions to guide your discussion later in this lesson.
Practice: Conduct practice interviews with your friends or family members. This will help you get comfortable with the process and identify areas where you need to improve.
Take notes: Take notes during the interview to help you remember important details. You can also use these notes to write a summary of the interview. Before taking notes or recording the conversation, ask for your client's consent first.
Listen: During the interview, listen carefully to your client's responses. Ask follow-up questions to clarify their answers or to learn more about their experiences.
Be professional: If you schedule a time to perform your interview, arrive on time. Thank them for their time at the end of the interview.
Be flexible: Be prepared to adjust your questions or approach based on the interviewee's responses. Sometimes, the best interviews are the ones that take unexpected turns.
After the interview, review your notes or recordings and summarize the main points. Identify the key insights, themes, and patterns that emerged from the client's responses. You can use tools like Microsoft Word or Excel to organize and visualize your data. Be sure to send a thank-you email to your client and share your findings and recommendations that you discover later in this lesson. You can also take the opportunity to ask for their feedback and suggestions for improvement.
