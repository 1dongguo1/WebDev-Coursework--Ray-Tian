This Unit first introduction to JavaScript, I gained a foundational understanding of how JavaScript enhances web interactivity. JavaScript is also very essential in create my own website. For example, I learned about basics of JavaScript input and output. And also combine my experience of using function in C++, I have completed the code challenge of lesson 3 with a button function. 'Onclick' is a very interesting element in my perspective. This is the first time I can make user interactive with my website. Not just hover their mouse on my avatar and watch the picture become bigger. And JavaScript can be used for modify HTML. Using 'document.getElementById'. It is very fascinating. After I click a button, the text will change. Make my website more vivid.
