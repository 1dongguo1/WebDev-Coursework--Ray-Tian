In this Unit, I started to learn styling with html. Different lists is very important in writing html. Such as ordered lists, unordered lists, description lists and nested lists. If their are a lot of elements in the webpage, use ordered list can order them with perfect style. And the users can easily to know which element is the first and which is second. I also learned about adding images. Insert Images can show the elements intuitive. The image can be an 'url' or in my local file. When an image can't show, there should be words to summarize the image.
