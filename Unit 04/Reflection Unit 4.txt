In this Unit, I started to learn styling with html. Different lists is very important in writing html. Such as ordered lists, unordered lists, description lists and nested lists. If their are a lot of elements in the webpage, use ordered list can order them with perfect style. And the users can easily to know which element is the first and which is second. I also learned about adding images. Insert Images can show the elements intuitive. The image can be an 'url' or in my local file. When an image can't show, there should be words to summarize the image. Reflecting on this, I'm amazed at how small details like proper list formatting or image descriptions can transform a page. Using small details can improve my design to be more professional, and I'm eager to explore how these techniques can solve real user problems, especially for those with accessibility needs. This unit has sparked my curiosity to experiment further.
