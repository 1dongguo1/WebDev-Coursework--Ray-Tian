Client Feedback Report: Special Coffee Website
1. First Impressions
"The page gives a cozy, rustic coffee shop vibe with the coffee bean background, but it feels a bit minimal—like an early draft rather than a final design. The color scheme is warm but could be more polished."

2. Three Descriptive Words
"Warm, Simple, Trustworthy"

3. Does It Match Your Expected Brand Style?
"It’s close, but I imagined something more ‘artisanal’ and premium. The current design feels functional but lacks some elegance."
