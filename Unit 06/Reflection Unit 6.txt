This Unit focus on feedback and iteration. I learned about adding links. When I hover my mouse on a link, there will also a brief introduction of the link. I learned about styling Images. I can change the border size, style, color and radius. 'Span' can cut my paragraph, to decorate each word. Which can make my html vivid. In addition, I practiced polishing my webpage using favicons and refined styling to make it look more professional. I also learned how to gather and apply client feedback, which is an important part of the design thinking process. It helps me understand how users feel and what they expect. This unit showed me that good design is not just about appearance, but also about listening and improving through iteration.
