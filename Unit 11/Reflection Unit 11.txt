I finish the study of html of vscode course. In this course, I learned about html. Using html to decorate my own website. Through the study, I have a superficial understanding about html, css and javascript. But the course only teach a little about javascript, which is not enough for me to create a thorough webpage. So I need to study more about javascript. So I'm going to use 'bilibili' to learn more about javascipt. But overall, I think the course is quite good. Because when I follow the course step by step, I have learned about how to design a webpage. This is something other online course will not teach you. Now I can make a basic html with some navigation bars and link to another html file. Next step I will also learn console. Using development tools of a browser properly can enhance my process of editing my html.
