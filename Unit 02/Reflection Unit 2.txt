In this Unit, I learned design and design thinking. It is useful for me to decorate my html page. Make my website looks tidy and organized can help the user to understand it easily. Also, a beautiful website can be more attractive. So I started to think what is design. "The Design Thinking Process", covered concepts such as "Design as a verb" and "Storytelling", teaching me a user-centered approach to problem-solving. These skills help me make my websites more appealing and functional, aligning with my goal to improve user experience. Designing is as essential as writing code. If you only know how to write code but don't know how to design your website, your website will be terrible.
