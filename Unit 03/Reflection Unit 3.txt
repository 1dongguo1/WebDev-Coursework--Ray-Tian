In Unit 3, I worked on a Client Project, applying HTML and design thinking to build a webpage for a client. Using HTML, I created a tidy, user-friendly webpage for Sara, building on my skills from Units 1 and 2. This project taught me to combine technical skills with user-centered design, preparing me for real-world web development challenges. It is very important to choose my client. Find what I really need. And combine with the knowledge I learned. This can build a stronger relationship to the theory and real world application.
