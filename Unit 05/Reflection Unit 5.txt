In Unit 5, I learned about CSS. CSS is for decorate my html. I can decorate my words with different color, font-size, font-family and background. For instance, I want to emphasize my title of a webpage, but only use 'strong' or 'bold' isn't very intuitive. So I will change the color of my title. To make my webpage more user-friendly. There are three main ways to use CSS: inline, internal, and external. Inline CSS is written directly in the HTML element, while internal CSS is placed inside a <style> tag within the HTML file. External CSS is more efficient when styling multiple pages—it requires creating a separate .css file and linking it to the main HTML file using the <link> tag. I also learned about CSS’s cascading rules, where the most specific style takes priority. CSS is a powerful tool for making websites more attractive, readable, and professional.
