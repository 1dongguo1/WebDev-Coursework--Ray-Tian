In Unit 5, I learned about CSS. CSS is for decorate my html. I can decorate my words with different color, font-size, font-family and background. For instance, I want to emphasize my title of a webpage, but only use 'strong' or 'bold' isn't very intuitive. So I will change the color of my title. There are two ways to write CSS. First is internal and the second is external. The external CSS need to create a file with extension '.css'. And add link to the main html file.
