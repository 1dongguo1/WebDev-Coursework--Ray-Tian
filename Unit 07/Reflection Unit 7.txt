In this unit I learned about global goals. Solve a problem and serve a purpose. I knew the global goals. I can apply design thinking. For the global goals I will choose 'Decent Work and Economic Growth'. I think “Decent Work and Economic Growth” is very important because everyone needs a job to live. But not all jobs are safe or fair. Some people work long hours and still don't get enough money. That's not right. I believe that all workers should have fair pay, good working conditions, and respect. Also, when more people have jobs, the country becomes stronger because the society is more stable. It helps reduce poverty and lets families have better lives. I also think young people like us should have chances to learn skills so we can get good jobs in the future. The government and companies should help create more jobs that are safe and fair.
