Introduction to the Global Goals
The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established in 2015 due to a combination of needs and actions that recognized the growing challenges and complexities of the 21st century. Several key factors led to their creation:

Recognition of Expired and Unmet Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): The SDGs followed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set in 2000 with targets for 2015. While significant progress was made in some areas, many goals were not fully met. The SDGs were designed to continue and expand upon this work, addressing the shortcomings and unfinished business of the MDGs.

Increased Global Challenges: Despite progress, many areas remained unresolved and unmet. Areas of concern such as poverty, climate change, general health and education, and economic instability escalated at an ever increasing rate.

Broader Consultation and Inclusivity: Unlike the MDGs, which were primarily formulated by a small group of stakeholders, the SDGs resulted from an inclusive, global negotiation process involving all member states and other stakeholders. This extensive consultation aimed to ensure the goals reflected a broad range of perspectives and priorities from around the world.

Integrating Sustainability: There was a growing understanding that economic growth should not come at the expense of the environment and social inclusion. The SDGs embraced a more holistic approach, emphasizing the need to balance economic, social, and environmental sustainability.

Technological and Social Advancements: Advances in technology and communication increased global connectivity and awareness, enabling better understanding and faster dissemination of best practices and knowledge to address complex global issues.

A Call for Action: Global movements and advocacy campaigns highlighted the urgency of addressing critical issues such as climate change, social injustice, and poverty. These movements created a groundswell of support for comprehensive and actionable goals.

A Framework for the Future: There was a clear need for a strong, future-oriented framework that would guide global development efforts beyond 2015, helping to ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet.

The SDGs were thus created as a universal call to action, reflecting the global consensus on the need to address the world's most pressing challenges comprehensively and collaboratively. They were designed to be interconnected and to balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection, laying out a path for the years to come to create a more sustainable, safer, and more prosperous planet for all.
