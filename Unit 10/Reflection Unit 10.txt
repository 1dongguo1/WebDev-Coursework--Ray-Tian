I think Unit 10 is the most important Unit. Because in this Unit I learned about basic file structure. I have organized my file. My images, javascript and css are stored in different files. Which make it easier to distinguish. It leads to cleaner code, faster development, and a more efficient workflow. And also deepened my understanding of navigation bars, teaching me how to create, style, and link them to different pages, enhancing user experience. Navigation bars have a large potential. It can be useful if I want to create a huge website. I especially like hover connect to the navigation bar. It makes my design vivid. Meanwhile, Lesson 3 taught me how to design my website. It focus on design principles, like visual hierarchy and consistency. I'm eager to apply these lessons to create websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I'm ready to create my own website.
